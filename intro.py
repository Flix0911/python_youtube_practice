# snack case
# my variable is stored 1. Can also equal an expression (1+1)
# 1 + "1" is an int + str
# python is strongly typed, data must be consistent
#  "1" + "1" is 11, but it's a string, not an int
# 1.0 is a float, has a decimal
# Booleans = true or false 
# 1 + True returns 2
# (True = 1, False = 0)

# whiz = " whiz"
# the f allows concatonation
# String expression
# my_var = f"Cheese {whiz}"

# boolean expression
my_var = 5 != 5 or 4 == 4
# my_var = 5 != 5 and 4 == 4


# str - string - str()
# int - integret - int()
# float - .X - float()
print(my_var)
